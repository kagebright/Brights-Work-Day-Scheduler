# 05: Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler

## Description:
  In this week's challenge, I will be creating a calendar application that 
  allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will 
  run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered 
  by jQuery.
